# pypassword.github.io
Developed a robust and user-friendly password generator application in Python to enhance security by creating strong, random passwords. This project demonstrates proficiency in Python programming, understanding of security principles, and ability to design user-centric software.
Key Features:

Random Password Generation: Generates secure passwords combining letters (both uppercase and lowercase), numbers, and special characters.
Customizable Password Length: Allows users to specify the desired length of the password.
Character Selection Options: Users can choose to include or exclude specific types of characters (e.g., only letters and numbers, or including special characters).
Clipboard Copy: Provides a functionality to copy the generated password directly to the clipboard for convenience.
User Interface: Implemented a simple and intuitive command-line interface (CLI) for user interaction.
Technologies Used:

Python: Core programming language used to develop the application.
random module: Utilized for generating random choices for the password characters.
string module: Used for accessing character sets (letters, digits, punctuation).
pyperclip module: Integrated for clipboard operations (optional).
